          <p>If you’re planning to lay sod in your yard, it’s important that you first have a good idea of how much space will be needed. Sod can’t just be thrown down haphazardly and not come up right. You need to measure out the area where you want the sod to go before laying it so that there are no accidents or discrepancies later on.
          Not only is this an important step for laying sod, but it’s also key when calculating what size of pile of sod should be ordered from your local landscaper or garden center.

            <li>6. Don’t forget to water your new sod until it’s established – you’ll want to keep it well-watered for several weeks in order for the roots to take hold and give it a healthy start. Watering more frequently will ensure that the grass has everything it needs, so be sure not to skimp on this step.</li>

            <li>8. As the sod begins to take root, water less frequently but continue to fertilize regularly.</li>

            <li>9. It’s best to avoid using a gas-powered or battery-powered lawn mower for about a month after you lay sod – while it may be tempting, it could damage your new lawn and is not recommended.</li>

            <li>10. Chances are you will want to do some landscaping in your yard, so make sure that’s planned out and ready before laying sod – your garden center or local landscaper may be able to help with this step!</li></p>

                All set? Now it’s time for the fun part – actually getting the sod down!
              </h2>
              <p style="color: white;">
                The first thing to do before laying sod is to figure out how much you need. Sod comes in squares known as pallets, which vary depending on the area of your lawn. You can calculate how many pallets you need by using this formula: 1) Multiply the length of the yard by its width to get the area in square feet. (You can convert the area to acres by dividing it by 43,560.) 2) Multiply this number by 0.15 and you’ll have how many pallets you will need. Once you know how much sod you’ll need, you can order your pallets of sod with confidence! Now you are ready to install your new lawn. First thing you’ll need for your sod installation is a tarp or pieces of plywood. While you will want to lay the sod in perfect lines, it’s best not to do it too quickly so that it doesn’t dry out and get damaged…you don’t want to see your beautiful new sod cracking and breaking after all the work you put into it! To ensure a perfectly even installation, take your time…you’ll want to lay down a piece of plywood or tarp before you begin laying sod. Then, using your small stakes and some rope (and probably about 10 friends!), stake the edges of the area where you are laying the sod. The edges won’t stay down on their own, so you’ll need to use stakes and ropes to hold them in place while they take root in your yard.

          <p style="text-align: center;">
            Sod installation can be a difficult process, especially if you are not familiar with the various steps. This article will walk you through all of the details so that your sod is installed correctly and beautifully.
          </p>
         <div style="border-radius: 5px; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; border-color: #58af0c; padding: 25px; text-align: -WEBKIT-CENTER;"><h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 22px;">Preparing your soil for sod installation:</h2>
          <p style="text-align: center;">Sod will not grow in compacted, infertile, or poorly drained soils. Before beginning your sod installation, be sure to have a well prepared area by amending the soil with a quality topsoil and compost mixture (available at all garden centers). This allows the soil to ‘breathe’ and become fertile so that the grass can thrive.
          </p>
          <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 22px;">Sod installation process:</h2>
          <p style="text-align: center;">After preparing your soil, rake it to a fine texture and then apply an organic mulch such as bark chips or pine straw to help control weeds. Now you are ready for sod installation! Begin by laying your sod in strips perpendicular to the property line, staggering the joints in each strip by about 6 inches. Continue laying strips until all of your sod is installed. After installation, water well and fertilize with an organic granular fertilizer (available at garden centers).</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
          Now your sod will begin to take hold and establish itself as it grows into a healthy yard! Continue watering well during the establishment period and you should have an attractive lawn in about 4 weeks. <br><br>We hope these tips help make your sod installation a success!</p>
